# All data were collected in accordance with the recommendations outlined in the ITU-T P.809 document. Our focus is exclusively on the performance of cloud gaming and user Quality of Experience (QoE); aspects such as immersion and game content were not evaluated.
# First and second datasets were collected in a wired testbed and third dataset in a wireless testbed with a smartphone as the client device. All details of both testbeds are in the articles below.

#Dataset Description:

>QoE - Label of QoE from 0 to 6, these being: extremely bad, very bad, bad, fair, good, excellent, and ideal.

>UsoCpu, UsoRam,UsoGpu and UsoVram were used to garantee that the hardware was not limiting the experiment.

>DelayComandos, JitterComandos and PerdaComandos are Input Delay, Jitter and Loss respectively.

>DelayVideo, JitterVideo and PerdaVideo are Video Delay, Jitter and Loss respectively.

>Jogo - Game played

>TerminoPartida - Time(HH.MM) of end of playtime

>JogariaNovamente - Would you play again like that? YES (SIM) or NO(NAO)

>EstadoEspirito - Are you happy? Happy (Feliz), Indiferent(Indiferente) and Sad (Triste)

>IDADE - Age

>GENERO - Gender

>CURSO - level of educational attainment

>HORASJOGASEMANA - Number of hours of videogames played at home in a weeek

>MOUSEMANETEVR - What hardware is used to play at home. "Nenhum" means no one.

>RESOLUCAO - Resolution of the monitor/tv used at home (When they dont know, we used -1080p, or less than 1080p)

>FREQUENCIA - Refresh rate of the monitor used to play at home (When they dont know, we used 60)

>QUALJAJOGOU	- if yhey played any game of the experiment before.

>TEMPOQUALJAJOGOU - if the last question was anwsered, for how long in hours?
